## Cocktails API

This is essentially a personal tinkering session to compare the (familiar) REST architecture with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org). However, if you wish to make use of it, you are welcome to do so.

The cocktail recipes are my own - feel free to try them out and adapt them to your own taste.

The alcohol units per cocktail serving are rounded to the nearest half unit, and an estimate based on the ingredients I have in my own cupboard; your mileage may vary. For example, Triple Sec can range in ABV from 15% to 40%, so your Margarita may end up a little stronger or lighter than mine, depending on the brands available to you.

## Prerequisites
